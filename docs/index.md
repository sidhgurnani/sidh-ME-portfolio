## **About Me**
Hello! I am a mechanical engineering graduate with a strong passion for learning, problem-solving, and developing innovative solutions. I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills while growing both professionally and personally. I’m excited to contribute to meaningful projects and to continuously improve through new challenges.

My experience includes working with various tools and programs that allow me to contribute to projects on all fronts, notably:

* **CAD & FEA:** Siemens NX, Creo Parametric, ANSYS  
* **Programming:** Arduino (C/C++), Python, MATLAB, Simulink, Java, HTML  
* **Other/Misc:** Computer Vision (YOLO), 3D Printing, Manual & CNC Machining, Microsoft Office

I enjoy tackling complex challenges that require a balance of creative thinking and technical precision. I am particularly motivated by opportunities that lead to innovative and practical solutions across a variety of engineering fields. This approach allows me to continuously learn and adapt as I grow in my career.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy exploring new interests and developing skills that broaden my perspective. I’m eager to collaborate with others and contribute to projects that drive meaningful results.
