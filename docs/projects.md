## **YOLO-Based Binary Object Sorting System**
_June 2024 to Present_

This ongoing project uses machine learning and computer vision to identify and sort physical objects in real time. While my background is in mechanical engineering, I’ve always enjoyed coding and wanted to explore the intersection of software and hardware. Under the guidance of Dr. Nirav Merchant (University of Arizona), I’ve been developing a prototype that combines Python, YOLO, and Arduino-based actuation.

## **Purdue Formula SAE: PF25 Drivetrain**
_June 2024 to May 2025_

While I joined Purdue Formula SAE in September 2022, my most significant contributions began after stepping into the role of Drivetrain System Owner. In this leadership position, I was responsible not only for overseeing the design and manufacturing process, but also for guiding and mentoring newer team members to foster long-term growth and continuity within the team.

## **The Data Mine: Data Science Undergraduate Reasearcher**
_January 2025 to May 2025_

I contributed to a collaborative project between The Data Mine at Purdue University and Kautex Textron, focusing on the development of a virtual melt flow index sensor. My primary role involved creating theoretical models that were used to validate and support the machine learning approach. This sensor aimed to improve quality control in fuel tank production by providing real-time insights into material properties. I also worked closely with team members to communicate findings and refine model accuracy through iterative testing and analysis.

## **Electric Vehicle Design (ME 49601EVD) Semester Projects**
_Fall 2024 Semester_

This course focused on the architecture and design principles behind electric vehicles, especially system-level decision-making.

I completed two major individual projects:

* **0–60 Time Calculator:** Built a tool to estimate acceleration times for three vehicle classes by modeling the two key EV acceleration regimes: constant power and constant acceleration. While not perfect, the calculator performs reliably in most cases. A PDF of the Excel file is rendered below.

* **Electric Go-Kart Design:** Tasked with designing a race-ready electric go-kart, I made and justified high-level decisions around powertrain, battery, and vehicle dynamics. This hypothetical design exercise emphasized applying system-level tradeoffs.

## **Tools, Methods, and Techniques for Rapid, Iterative Product Design and Analysis (ME 49601TMT) Semester Project**
_Fall 2024 Semester_

This course provided advanced hands-on experience with Siemens NX for solid, surface, and assembly modeling, as well as FEA analysis. Additionally, the class introduced basic CFD simulations using Simcenter StarCCM+.

For the group project, I led the surface modeling of an RC car body and conducted CFD analysis to explore its aerodynamic performance.

## **Technical Article - AEIS Internship Project**
_Summer 2023_

While pursuing my internship at AEIS, one of the assignments I was tasked with was writing a technical article of any topic of my choosing. Given my interest in cars, I chose to look at the engine and study the common reasons behind why pistons fail. 

Attached here is the technical article, as well as the presentation I made and presented to my supervisors.
